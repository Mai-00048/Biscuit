**Shaboura Immersion Time Calculator**

Because apparently, this is what my life has come to—creating a tool to calculate how long to dunk a Shaboura into tea. Yep, this is where I am now. Anyway, let’s just dive into the code that will probably save your Shaboura from total annihilation.

**The Brilliant Formula**

Here it is, in all its glory:

**How the App Works (Because I Have to Explain It)**

First, we need to calculate the viscosity:

**Choose one of the types of tea:**
- Karak Tea
- Green Tea (No Sugar)
- Red Tea with Sugar

**Tea Temperature:**  
According to our formula, there is an inverse relationship between time and viscosity. The higher the viscosity (such as Karak tea), the longer the time. But if the tea is cold, the viscosity will increase more than if it were hot.

- **Hot** – Go ahead, burn your mouth. No one's stopping you.
- **Warm** – You’re too lazy to wait, but you’re not a monster who drinks cold tea.
- **Cold** – If you choose this, reconsider your life. Seriously.

**Shaboura Immersion Depth:**
- **Light Dunk** – Quick dip.
- **Medium Dunk** – Not too long, not too short. The sweet spot for perfectionists.
- **Full Dunk** – Go all in. Drown that Shaboura. You’re committed now.

Finally, click that button to reveal the perfect time to dunk your Shaboura into your tea.

There you go. A tool to figure out how long to dunk your Shaboura into your tea. I know, it’s groundbreaking.
